# Parser-Generation-Project

The goal of the project is to learn about the parser generator, how a parse tree is generated and how the grammar creates a parse tree. Here I tried to implement some basic features of partially C language, partially from Python and Ruby as well to see the working procedure of the parser generator. In this grammar we have included automated variable procedure, used loop, and also used if, elseif and else and functions.
